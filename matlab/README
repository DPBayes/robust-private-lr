OVERVIEW

This folder contains the implementation for the methods that we compared to our 
robust private linear regression algorithm. These methods use fixed precision 
parameter values and an even budget split between two sufficient statistics.
The code is scripted for automatic execution of the experiments for the 
validation purpose, given the data sets.

Given the size of the data sets and the fact that they are not our original 
work, they have been removed from the version included as supplementary 
material.


EXECUTE

As the original data files are too large to be included in this package, the 
input data files have to be created first using the following steps:

1. Do the "step 0" in the Python implementation (see python/README). This 
produces files GDSC_geneexpr.h5 and GDSC_drugres.h5. Place these files in the 
matlab/Data/ver3 directory.
2. Run the Python script matlab/src/h5tocsv.py. This produces files 
GeneExpression.csv and DrugResponse.csv in matlab/Data/ver3.
3. Run the Matlab script matlab/src/csvtomat.m. This produces files 
GeneNames.mat, GeneExpression.mat, DrugResponse.mat, and drug_stats.mat 
in matlab/Data/ver3.

After this, to run the actual algorithms, run command 
>> run_rplr_exp
inside the directory matlab/src.

The privacy parameter epsilon is set in run_rplr_exp.m file on line 221/222. 
In our experiments, the algorithm was executed in both cases eps=1 and eps=2.
The algorithm takes several hours to run.


DATA AND DIRECTORIES

Data and output directories are set. The code will automatically preprocess the
data and generate intermediate outputs. The output results from private linear 
regression (plr), output-perturbed linear regression (oplr), and functional 
mechanism (fmlr) in directories codir and wodir then have to be converted into 
csv files using resultstocsv.m scripts inside these directories. The final 
plots are generated using the Python implementation.


READABILITY OF THE SOURCE CODE

The source code is not fully cleaned up and commented, but some comments have 
been included for quick check. It also contains some additional codes that are 
not used in our experiments.
