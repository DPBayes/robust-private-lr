# robust-private-lr

This repository contains the Python and Matlab implementations used to study the 
robust private linear regression algorithm. The actual algorithm is implemented
in Python, please first see the README in the directory python/gdscdata. An older 
version of the algorithm and a few other methods used in comparisons are 
implemented in Matlab, see the README in the directory matlab/ if necessary.
